PRIVACY POLICY for "Page Visits Counter Lite" WordPress Plugin

	This Privacy Policy outlines how the "Page Visits Counter Lite" WordPress plugin ("the Plugin," "we," "our," or "us") collects,
	uses, and protects user information. By using the Plugin, you agree to the practices described in this policy.



Collection and Use of Information

	The plugin is designed to provide a simple and lightweight solution for counting page visits
	on your WordPress website. It collects minimal information solely for the purpose of providing accurate page visit statistics.
	The Plugin does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.



Types of Data Collected

	- Page Visits Data:
			The Plugin counts the number of page visits on your website.
			It distinguishes between unique visits and page refreshes.
			It also maintains separate counters for total website visits with and without page refreshes.


	- Hashed IP Addresses:
			In order to differentiate between a new page visit and a page refresh,
			the Plugin hashes the user's IP address using one-way encryption.
			This hashed IP address is stored in the WordPress database for a duration of one hour.

				Example:
					Original IP: 192.168.1.1
					Hashed IP: 18a409fe5cd86359fc6f4289e0324ab971e72d50eacb60cf0a170cf6f35ac31f


	- Data Storage and Retention


	- Page Visit Data:
			The Plugin stores page visit data within your WordPress installation.
			This data is not shared with any third-party companies and is not sent to external servers.


	- Hashed IP Addresses:
			The hashed IP addresses are stored in the WordPress database for a limited duration of one hour.
			After this period, the hashed IP addresses are automatically purged from the database.



Data Sharing

	The Plugin does not share any user data, including page visit counts or hashed IP addresses,
	with any third-party companies or services.



Cookies and Cache

	The Plugin does not utilize cookies or store any user data in internet browser cache memory.



Security

	We take the security and privacy of your data seriously. The hashed IP addresses stored in the WordPress database
	are one-way encrypted and cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal the original IP addresses.
	We implement reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data.



Children's Privacy

	The Page Visits Counter Lite Plugin is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
	We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.



Changes to this Privacy Policy

	We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time.
	Changes to the policy will be included with each plugin update, and the "Last Updated" date will be adjusted accordingly.
	The latest version of the Privacy Policy will always be available within the plugin.
